# Wellington
In honor of the inventor of the first noiseless typewriter, 'Wellington' is a quiet theme for the amazing blogging engine Ghost. The design is unobstrusive, focussing the visitor on the content (and hopefully turning him into a reader). It's best suited for blogs that want to focus on their posts.

The general look and feel is stolen from various classy designs and is supposed to feel very 'high gloss magazine'.

## Features
- Customizable Logo: The logo is based on the free Google Font ‘[Rozha One](http://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Rozha+One)’. I recommend creating an image-based logo, but a CSS-only option is available. If no image logo is present, the theme will automatically include the font using Google Fonts and use the title set in `/partials/header.hsb`.
- Menu for Static Pages: A menu for static pages can be used. Since Ghost currently lacks APIs to query for static pages, a bit of manual work is required. The file `/partials/header.hsb` allows configuration of the menu.
- Sharing Buttons: Twitter, Facebook & Google Plus are already enabled sharing options, but
