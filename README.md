# Wellington
In honor of the inventor of the first noiseless typewriter, 'Wellington' is a quiet theme for the amazing blogging engine Ghost. The design is unobstrusive, focussing the visitor on the content (and hopefully turning him into a reader). It's best suited for blogs that want to focus on their posts.

The general look and feel is stolen from various classy designs and is supposed to feel very 'high gloss magazine'.
